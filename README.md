Our project will explore the voting record of Georgia's elected representatives (Senators and house members). We plan to gather the voting records of each representative from the current year's Congress. We will create a map for each of Georgia's different congressional distracts. From this map you will be able to click each district to learn more about its representative. For each representative we will display metrics such as how many bills they have passed, to what degree they vote along party lines, the category of bills they have proposed, and so on and so forth. We also plan to display some general demographic data for Georgia's voting population.

We will use Jupyter Notebook to make API calls to ProPublica to gather the voting data, store the data into an SQLite database and then display the data with Javascript via Flask. Our dataset has the voting history of Georgia's representatives, which comprises well over 100 data points. JavaScript libraries we will make use of are D3, Plotly, Canvas.js, and Leaflet.
